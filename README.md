# 🛒 Retail Sales Analysis (SQL Project)

## 📌 Overview
This project performs end-to-end SQL analysis on a retail dataset containing customer, product, and sales information.  
It includes **data cleaning**, **validation**, and **exploratory data analysis (EDA)** to produce meaningful business insights.

The goal of this project is to replicate real-world SQL tasks performed by data analysts.

- Ensured each transaction is unique and valid.

### ✔️ Handled Missing & Invalid Values
- Checked for NULL or blank fields in all three tables.
- Corrected missing `Location` values by replacing with `"NA"`.
- Removed invalid records such as unrealistic ages.



### ✔️ Corrected Price Mismatch
- Compared product price in `sales_transaction` vs `product_inventory`.
- Updated incorrect prices to ensure consistent and accurate calculations.

### ✔️ Validated Business Rules
- Ensured stock levels were non-negative.
- Checked for invalid or zero product prices.
- Identified and removed impossible future JoinDates.
